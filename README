Given a database and a directory, this module (and its accompanying script)
will create stub Class::DBI sub-class modules.  It differs from
Class::DBI::AutoLoader in that it spits out code instead of just magickally
instantiating classes.

To install, do the usual dance:

$ perl Makefile.PL
$ make
$ make test
$ sudo make install
